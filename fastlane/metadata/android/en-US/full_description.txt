TourCount supports species-specific and individually GPS-localized registering of butterflies. 

New in Version  3.6.5:
- Option to set the proximity Wakelock sensitivity (if supported by device)
- Corrected message when there is no suitable file for import
- Export to a Basic DB now writes the tour name into the filename
- Import of a Basic DB with file selection
- Optional button vibration fixed for Android Version > 11
- Some other bugfixes
- Code, data and layout improvements
- Docs updated

Features:
- Data recording is organized for a regional tour with its expected butterfly species.
- Databases can be individually created and adapted within the app regarding meta data and expected butterfly species.
- The app has an internal pool of many European species and comes with a prepared basic database with the most common species in Europe as a starting point for direct use.
- Separate counters for ♂-♀-indeterminate, ♂, ♀, pupa, larva or egg.
- You may use an individual species list per region.
- Results are prepared for easy readout to transfer them to the science4you entry mask for butterfly registration.
- Results may be exported in SQLite- or CSV-format (for transfer to a PC for your own processing, e.g. in a spreadsheet.)
- Help contains a detailed userguide.

Functions:
- Editor for metadata in preparation for an inspection
- Counter page with scroll-down list for species selection
- Editor for individual species data of a count (e.g. status, remark or bulk count entry).
- The app automatically inserts date, time, coordinates and height as well as location data by reverse OSM-geocoding provided that GPS and internet are accessible.
- The app provides functions to add, delete or edit the species for the current species list.
- The results page shows metadata, notes, totals and counting results per species.

Prerequisites:
The app demands for 
- storage access permit for importing and exporting counting data,
- GPS (Location) permit for coordinates and location info per count, 
- internet access for OpenStreetMap reverse geocoding requests, 
- the permit to set the screen brightness,
- the permit to prevent the sleep mode.

The smartphone screen should have a minimum resolution of 1920 x 1024 pixels. 
The app is usable with Android version 7.1 (Nougat) or newer.

TourCount is one of two apps for European butterfly monitoring. 
The 2nd app, TransektCount serves transect counters on their inspection walks. It supports species-specific counting of butterflies per transect section according to the European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme method.

Both apps use the coding scheme of Karsholt/Razowski for European butterflies and thus contain only European butterfly pictures.
