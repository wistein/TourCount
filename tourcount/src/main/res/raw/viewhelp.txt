  % 1. Introduction
  !
  ! This counting app should support you when recording butterflies. It allows to register individuals species-specific, separated by sexus and metamorphic stages as well as individually localized in the field.
  ! It facilitates this comfortably without field book and pencil on every stay in nature.
  _ 
  ! The integrated database can be individually created and adapted regarding expected butterfly species.
  ! The recorded data (meta-data, counts and remarks) may either be read on the smartphone for transfer into the butterfly registration system (e.g. on www.science4you.org) or transferred to a PC for your own processing.
  _ 
  ! The app is open source (published under <a href="https://github.com/wistein/TourCount" target="_blank">https://github.com/wistein/TourCount</a>),
  ! has no tracking or advertising functions, demands only for permissions which are needed for recording the counting data (access rights for storage and GPS as well as internet for reverse geocoding.)

  % 2. Setting up
  !
  ! Before initial use you should adapt the settings to your liking. 
  _ 
  ! Then you should edit the preliminary species list. (On the counting page use the Pencil-Button in the action bar for this).
  ! Here, on the blue page you may add more species per Checkboxes from an integrated list of european species.
  _ 
  ! Alternatively, you could download a more comprehensive or special example Basic DB (see <a href="https://github.com/wistein/TourCount/tree/master/docs" target="_blank">https://github.com/wistein/TourCount/tree/master/docs</a>).
  ! Copy it to the app's data directory "Documents/TourCount" which is created during the first start of the app.
  ! Now import and edit it suitably.
  _ 
  ! Then you may enter general parts of the master data under “Edit meta data” and finish this by clicking the saving symbol.
  ! Location-related meta data derived from GPS coordinates will be inserted automatically, when reverse geocoding is activated under “Settings”.
  ! The editable meta data may be modified anytime later.
  _
  ! Tip: Date and time can be entered by tapping the relevant field. If a different date or time is to be entered, these fields can be pressed longer and the input dialog that then opens can be used.
  _ 
  ! Then edit the counting species list on "Counting". Open the "Edit species list" page by the Pencil-Button in the action bar of the counting page.
  ! The (+)-button opens the blue "Add species" page, where you can select further species to be added to the counting list. At the end of this list you may select a place holder for a not yet known species (NN), which could be edited afterwards by entering its scientific name, common name and code (five-digit with leading zeros, see List of coded Butterflies.pdf <a href="https://github.com/wistein/TourCount/tree/master/docs" target="_blank">https://github.com/wistein/TourCount/tree/master/docs</a>), e.g.:
  _
  !               TourCount species list (partly)
  ! ---------------------------------------------
  ! ...
  ! Pieris rapae .............. 06998
  ) Small white
  ! Pieris napi ................ 07000
  ) Green-veined white
  ! Pontia daplidice ....... 07005
  ) Bath white
  ! ...
  _ 
  ! The codes will be used as an option to sort the list and as a reference to show corresponding butterfly pictures on the counting and results page.
  ! The codes derive from the numbering scheme of european butterflies by Karsholt/Razowski, as used e.g. in the German Lepiforum <a href="https://lepiforum.org/" target="_blank">https://lepiforum.org/</a>.
  _
  ! Going back stores the changes into the current counting list. This list can be changed or supplemented anytime afterwards.
  _ 
  ! When you have entered the meta data and created the counting list for all expected species, the database is ready for export as a "Basic Database".
  ! To do this, you can use the function "Export as Basic DB" in the menu of the starting page. 
  ! After that you have a copy of the empty database saved as "Basic Database" (tourcount0.db) in the app's data directory (Documents/TourCount).
  _ 
  ! The Basic DB may be used as a template for further tour recordings. You may export the Basic DB anytime later, e.g. when you inserted new species. Saving as a Basic DB ignores all inspection-specific counting data.

  % 3. Usage
  !
  ! Start with "Edit meta data". Enter the relevant meta date of the tour.
  _
  ! Continue with "Counting". Select the species by clicking the species line to scroll down the species list.
  ! To count just tip on the (+)-Button of the corresponding category (♂ od. ♀, ♂, ♀, pupa, larva, egg) of the species.
  ! The counter will increment and a page opens to enter individual data. Location info, latitude, longitude, height as well as date and time will be added automatically.
  ! Location may be edited and condition rating (state 0-6 with 0 = undefined, 1 = very good) as well as multiple counts may be applied here. Go back to the counting page by clicking the "Save" button.
  ! The (-)-Buttons allow for corrections. Mind that the (-)-Buttons reduce the individuals list in a last-in-first-out-mode for the corresponding species category. 
  _ 
  ! The Pencil-Button in the action bar of the counting page opens the counting list editing page for editing the list of species.
  _ 
  ! The Pencil-Button on top of the counting field opens the species editing page that lets you add a remark for each species that will be shown aside of it. 
  _ 
  ! To move back one page you can use the Back-Button or arrow in the left upper corner. To make sure to save edited content you should go back by clicking the Save-Button. 
  ! Before leaving TourCount after a tour you should complete the meta data and save the current countings by exporting the internal DB (->tourcount_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmmss.db).
  _ 
  ! The results page can be opened with SHOW RESULTS-Button or the Eye-symbol in the app-bar. It shows all the registered data orderly arranged.
  ! Beneath the meta data it shows the totals followed by a list of all counted species with their individual records sorted by recorded time to the second.
  _
  ! When you have a large list or have collected big amounts of data the start of the results page may be delayed, as this needs some calculations.

  % 4. Further functions
  !
  ! The menu on the starting page has Settings, Reset, Import, Export, Info and Help functions. 
  _ 
  ! In "Settings" you may adapt the look an feel in some aspects to your wishes, e.g. sounds, sorting order or left-/right-hand counting.
  ! Here you should enter a valid email address, if you want a reliable Reverse Geocoding function.
  _ 
  ! Reverse Geocoding allows for automatic insertion of statements of place (postal code, city, place) into meta data and location data into the individual's record.
  ! For Reverse Geocoding (to produce address info from GPS coordinates) the free service of Nominatim from OpenStreetMap is used.
  ! A valid own email address is necessary for durably reliable queries of address data and to exclude abuse.
  ! The mail address will be treated confidentially and will only be used to contact you in case of service problems.
  ! For more info see <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim" target="_blank">https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim</a>.
  _ 
  ! For preparing a new tour you may use "Reset Data" to reset the tour-specific meta data and all count data. Alternatively you may import the Basic DB or any other prepared tourcount-DB.
  _ 
  ! Internally, TourCount stores the data always in a single, equally named SQlite-DB in the app's own protected storage area that is not accessible by the user.
  ! Therefore, exporting the data to files in a user reachable storage area is necessary.
  ! The use of different user DB files (e.g. for different regions) is also only possible via import and export.
  _ 
  ! Exporting the DB as empty "Basic DB" is reasonable, when lasting changes of the counting list have been made (e.g. new species added).
  _
  ! The “Import Basic DB” function always reads in the file "tourcount0.db" from "Documents/TourCount".
  _
  ! You may import any previously exported TourCount-DB. This supports monitoring on different tours.
  ! To achieve this you may create tour-specific Basic DBs which may be renamed by a file manager into e.g. tourcount1.db, tourcount2.db, etc.
  ! (Mind: The db file name must always start with “tourcount”, otherwise the file cannot be imported).
  _ 
  ! "Export current DB" writes a copy of the internal DB to "Documents/TourCount/tourcount_YYYY-MM-DD_hhmmss.db".
  _
  ! The function “Export Data -> CSV File” writes the counting results into the pre-formatted spreadsheet-readable file "tourcount_YYYY-MM-DD_hhmmss.csv" to "Documents/TourCount".
  ! This directory allows accessing the files by other spreadsheet apps, like Collabora (obtainable from F-Droid).
  _ 
  ! IT-affine users may transfer the exported "tourcount_YYYY-MM-DD_hhmmss.db" from "Documents/TourCount" to a PC.
  ! With a free tool like "SQliteBrowser" (<a href="http://sqlitebrowser.org/" target="_blank">http://sqlitebrowser.org</a>) you may examine and edit the .db-files.
  _
  ! You may also copy a .csv-file from Documents/TourCount/ to a PC and import it into a spreadsheet program for further processing (under Android you may import it into a free app like Collabora).
  ! In order to display the formats and character sets correctly, please import it
  _
  ! - as a comma-separated text file with
  ! - file origin “Unicode UTF-8”,
  ! - quotations marks for textfield recognition and
  ! - all columns in text format.
  _
  ! Under "App Info" you find the email address of the author and the history of the app development.
  ! Under "Licenses" you find the license notes.
  _ 
  ! The menu of the counting page provides a "Share" function for sending notes using a standard app, like SMS or email.
  _ 
  ! The counting page is temporarily switched off by means of the proximity sensor when the phone is put into a pocket or held closed to the body.
  ! This saves energy, prohibits unwanted input and recalls the app into its current state immediately when used again.
